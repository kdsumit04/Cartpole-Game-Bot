# Cartpole-Game-Bot
Developed an Artificial Intelligence Bot using a Neural Network to solve OpenAIâ€™s Cartpole balancing environment. 
Created simulator and generated training dataset by playing 10000 games, appended it when game score crosses threshold.

Tuned the NN model and achieved an accuracy of 98% by testing out the trained model on the fabricated simulator
